  <h2>Validation of basic email elements when sending an email</h2>
  <p> When a user is composing a message in gmail and attempts to send it, some basic validation should occur. This warns the user if:
    <ul>
      <li>
        they are about to send an email with the subject and email body left blank
      </li>
      <li>
        the recipient address they are sending to is badly formed
      </li>
      <li>
        the email body indicates that a file should be attached, but no files are attached
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <div concordion:example="basic element validation">
    <h3>Recipient address, Subject, Email body validation</h3>

    <table concordion:execute="#message = sendEmail(#to, #subject, #body)">

    <p>
      When a user composes an email which suggests that they intend to attach a file, they want to avoid the embarrassment of forgetting the add the attachment before sending. If the email body contains a phrase suggesting a file should be attached, but there is no file attached, then the user should be warned with the message “<span concordion:set="#warningMessage">It seems like you have forgotten to attach a file</span>”.
    </p>
